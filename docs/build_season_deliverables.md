## Build Season Deliverables

### Week 1
* Programming environments up to date on all development machines
* Team understands command-based robot concepts
* RecycleRush repo forked and branched in GitHub for week 2 tasks

* Design review content
  * Detail command based robot
  * Describe use of Github
  * Identify need for testbenches and defined periods of exlusive use of previous robots

### Week 2
* Develop against 2015 robot to implement PID on DOG elevator
* Develop against a drivebase to implement feedback-based fixed distance movement
  * Test hardware documented (pictured and brief writeup)
  * Code reviews performed
  * Code checked into GitHub

* Design review content
  * Detail the work performed in both exercises
  * Include any successes and failures

### Week 3
* Develop against testbenches or prototypes to assist game mech / drivetrain feasibility
