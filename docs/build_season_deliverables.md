# Build Season Deliverables

## Week 1
* Programming environments up to date on all development machines
* Team understands command-based robot concepts
* RecycleRush repo forked and branched in GitHub for week 2 tasks

* Design review content
  * Detail command based robot
  * Describe use of Github
  * Identify need for testbenches and defined periods of exlusive use of previous robots

## Week 2
* Develop against 2015 robot to implement positional PID on DOG elevator
* Develop against an existing drivebase to implement positional PID fixed distance movement
  * Test hardware documented (pictured and brief writeup)
  * Code reviews performed
  * Code checked into GitHub

* Design review content
  * Detail the work performed in both exercises above
  * Include any successes and failures

## Week 3
* Develop against testbenches or prototypes to assist game mech / drivetrain feasibility
  * Subsystem diagram for testbench / prototype
  * Diagram for commands
  * Use RobotBuilder to generate testbench code
  * Create separate GitHub repos for each testbench

* Design review content
  * Detail work performed to determine if prototype concepts are feasible
  * Include any successes and failures

## Week 4
* Design of Game Mech Code
* Design of Drivebase Code
* Design of Diagnostic Code (everything's awesome)
  * Block diagram of overall control system
  * Block diagrams of individual subsystems with completed subsystem design forms
  * State diagrams of commands (or chains of commands) with completed command design forms
  * Git repos created and initialized in GitHub (inc .gitignore)

* Design review content
  * Review diagrams generated as part of design
  * Ensure it meets needs of the entire team

## Week 5
* Implementation and Test of Game Mech Code
* Implementation and Test of Drivetrain Code
  * Programming Checklist(s) completed
  * Testing completed
  * Code reviews performed
  * Code released in GitHub
  
* Design review content
