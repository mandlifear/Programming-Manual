## The Scrum Board
The scrum board is where we keep track of our progress for what we’ve finished, what we’re working on, and what we need to work on.  The following table explains each of the different categories on the scrum board.

The Scrum board sections include:

**Planned:** Not currently being worked on.

**WIP:** Work in Progress. Currently being worked on or tested.

**Done:** Feature implemented and tested with possible inputs (good inputs, edge cases, bad inputs) on either a functioning test bench, simulator, or robot.

## Daily Standup Meetings
1. What did you do last time?
2. Any problems or concerns? 
3. What are you doing today?

## Weekly Planning

Plan always at least a week ahead.
